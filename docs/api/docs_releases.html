<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md124"></a>
GBDK 2020 4.0</h2>
<p>2020/10/01</p><ul>
<li>GBDK now requires SDCC 4.0.3 or higher, that has fully working toolchain. Old link-gbz80 linker is not used anymore, sdldgb and makebin are used to link objects and produce binary roms; maccer tool is no longer needed either<ul>
<li>SDCC 4.0.3 has much better code generator which produces smaller and faster code. Code is twice faster</li>
<li>SOURCE LEVEL DEBUGGING is possible now! Native toolchain produces *.CDB files that contain detailed debug info. Look for EMULICIOUS extension for vs.code. It supports breakpoints, watches, inspection of local variables, and more!</li>
<li>SDCC 4.0.4 has fixed RGBDS support; library is not updated to support that in full yet, but it is possible to assemble and link code emitted by SDCC with RGDBS</li>
<li>New banked trampolines are used, they are faster and smaller</li>
<li>New (old) initialization for non-constant arrays do NOT require 5 times larger rom space than initialized array itself, SDCC even tries to compress the data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Library was improved<ul>
<li>itoa/ltoa functions were rewritten, div/mod is not required now which is about 10 times faster</li>
<li>sprite functions are inline now, which is faster up to 12 times and produces the same or smaller code; .OAM symbol is renamed into _shadow_OAM that allows accessing shadow OAM directly from C code</li>
<li>interrupt handling was revised, it is now possible to make dedicated ISR's, that is important for time-sensitive handlers such as HBlank.</li>
<li>printf/sprintf were rewritten and splitted, print functions are twice faster now and also requre less rom space if you use <a class="el" href="stdio_8h.html#a6c8d9c5b5b6a760b5b2787f0f96b690e">sprintf()</a> only, say, in bgb_emu.h</li>
<li>crash_handler.h - crash handler that allows to detect problems with ROMs after they are being released (adapted handler, originally written by ISSOtm)</li>
<li>improved and fixed string.h</li>
<li>many other improvements and fixes - thanks to all contributors!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revised examples</li>
<li>Improved linux support</li>
<li>Lcc has been updated<ul>
<li>it works with the latest version of sdcc</li>
<li>quoted paths with spaces are working now</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md125"></a>
GBDK 2020 3.2</h2>
<p>2020/06/05</p><ul>
<li>Fixed OAM initialization that was causing a bad access to VRAM</li>
<li>Interrupt handlers now wait for lcd controller mode 0 or 1 by default to prevent access to inaccessible VRAM in several functions (like set_bkg_tiles)</li>
<li>Several optimizations here and there</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md126"></a>
GBDK 2020 3.1.1</h2>
<p>2020/05/17</p><ul>
<li>Fixed issues with libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll</li>

GBDK 2020 3.1</h2>
<p>2020/05/16</p><ul>
<li>Banked functions are working! The patcher is fully integrated in link-gbz80, no extra tools are needed. It is based on Toxa's work<ul>
<li>Check this post for more info</li>
<li>Check the examples/gb/banked code for basic usage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>USE_SFR_FOR_REG is the default now check here why <a href="https://gbdev.gg8.se/forums/viewtopic.php?id=697">https://gbdev.gg8.se/forums/viewtopic.php?id=697</a></li>
<li>Fixed examples that were not compiling in the previous version and some improvements in a few of them. Removed all warnings caused by changing to the new SDCC</li>
<li>Fixed bug in lcc that was causing some files in the temp folder not being deleted</li>
<li>Removed as-gbz80 (the lib is now compiled with sdasgb thanks to this workaround) <a href="https://github.com/Zal0/gbdk-2020/commit/d2caafa4a66eb08998a14b258cb66af041a0e5c8">https://github.com/Zal0/gbdk-2020/commit/d2caafa4a66eb08998a14b258cb66af041a0e5c8</a></li>

GBDK 2020 3.0</h2>
<p>2020/04/12</p><ul>
<li>Initial GBDK 2020 release <br  />
 Updated SDCC to v4.0 The new linker is not working so the old version is still there There is an issue with sdagb compiling drawing.s (the JP in line 32 after ".org .MODE_TABLE+4*.G_MODE" it's writing more than 4 bytes invading some addresses required by input.s:41) Because of this, all .s files in libc have been assembled with the old as-gbz80 and that's why it is still included</li>

Historical GBDK Release Notes</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md131"></a>
GBDK 2.96</h2>
<p>17 April, 2000 <br  />
 Many changes. <br  />
</p><ul>
<li>Code generated is now much more reliable and passes all of sdcc's regression suite.</li>
<li>Added support for large sets of local variables (&gt;127 bytes).</li>
<li>Added full 32 bit long support.</li>
<li>Still no floating pt support.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md132"></a>
GBDK 2.95-3</h2>
<p>19th August, 2000 <br  />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Stopped lcc with sdcc from leaking .cdb files all across /tmp.</li>
<li>Optimised &lt; and &gt; for 16 bit varibles.</li>
<li>Added a new lexer to sdcc. Compiling files with large initalised arrays takes 31% of the time (well, at least samptest.c does :) <br  />
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an experimental release for those who feel keen. The main change is a new lexer (the first part in the compilation process which recognises words and symbols like '!=' and 'char' and turns them into a token number) which speeds up compilation of large initialised arrays like tile data by a factor of three. Please report any bugs that show up - this is a big change.</p>
<p>I have also included a 'minimal' release for win32 users which omits the documentation, library sources, and examples. If this is useful I will keep doing it.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md133"></a>
GBDK 2.95-2</h2>
<p>5th August, 2000 <br  />
 Just a small update. From the README:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added model switching support &ndash;model-medium uses near (16 bit) pointers for data, and banked calls for anything not declared as 'nonbanked' &ndash;model-small uses near (16 bit) pointers for data and calls. Nothing uses banked calls. 'nonbanked' functions are still placed in HOME. Libraries are under lib/medium and lib/small.</li>
<li>Added the gbdk version to 'sdcc &ndash;version'</li>
<li>Changed the ways globals are exported, reducing the amount of extra junk linked in.</li>
<li>Turned on the optimisations in flex. Large constant arrays like tile data should compile a bit faster.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md134"></a>
GBDK 2.95</h2>
<p>22nd July, 2000</p><ul>
<li>Fixed 'a &lt;&lt; c' for c = [9..15]</li>
<li>no$gmb doesn't support labels of &gt; 32 chars. The linker now trims all labels to 31 chars long.</li>
<li>Fixed wait_vbl for the case where you miss a vbl</li>
<li>Fixed + and - for any type where sizeof == 2 and one of the terms was on the stack. This includes pointers and ints. Fixes the text output bug in the examples. Should be faster now as well. Note that + and - for longs is still broken.</li>
<li>Fixed the missing */ in gb.h</li>
<li>Added basic far function support. Currently only works for isas and rgbasm. See examples/gb/far/*</li>
<li>bc is now only pushed if the function uses it. i.e. something like: int silly(int i) { return i; } <br  />
 will not have the push bc; pop bc around it.</li>
<li>Better rgbasm support. Basically: o Use "sdcc -mgbz80 --asm=rgbds file.c" for each file.c o Use "sdcc -mgbz80 --asm=rgbds crt0.o gbz80.lib gb.lib file1.o file2.o..."</li>
</ul>
<p>to link everything together. The .lib files are generated using astorgb.pl and sdcc to turn the gbdk libraries into something rgbds compatible. The libraries are <em>not</em> fully tested. Trust nothing. But give it a go :)</p><ul>
<li>Ran a spell checker across the README and ChangeLog <br  />
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a recommended upgrade. Some of the big features are:</p>
<p>Decent rgbds support. All the libraries and most of the examples can now compile with rgbds as the assembler. Banked function support. It is now easier to break the 32k barrier from within C. Functions can live in and be called transparently from any bank. Only works with rgbds Fixed some decent bugs with RSH, LSH, and a nasty bug with + and - for int's and pointers. Various optimisations in the code generator.</p>
<p>7th July, 2000 <br  />
 Information on float and long support. Someone asked about the state of float/long support recently. Heres my reply:</p>
<p>long support is partly there, as is float support. The compiler will correctly recognise the long and float keywords, and will generate the code for most basic ops (+, -, &amp;, | etc) for longs correctly and will generate the function calls for floats and hard long operations (*, /, %) correctly. However it wont generate float constants in the correct format, nor will it 'return' a long or float - gbdk doesn't yet support returning types of 4 bytes. Unfortunately its not going to make it into 2.95 as there's too much else to do, but I should be able to complete long support for 2.96</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md135"></a>
GBDK 2.94</h2>
<p>7th May, 2000 <br  />
 Many fixes - see the README for more.</p>
<p>7th May - Library documentation up. A good size part of the libraries that go with gbdk have been documented - follow the HTML link above to have a look. Thanks to quang for a good chunk of the gb.h documentation. Please report any errors :)</p><ul>
<li>Fixed #define BLAH 7 // Unterminated ' error in sdcpp<ul>
<li>Fixed SCY_REG += 2, SCY_REG -= 5 (add and subtract in indirect space) as they were both quite broken.</li>
<li>externs and static's now work as expected.</li>
<li>You can now specify which bank code should be put into using a #pragma e.g: #pragma bank=HOME Under rgbds and asxxxx putting code in the HOME bank will force the code into bank 0 - useful for library functions. The most recent #pragma bank= will be the one used for the whole file.</li>
<li>Fixed an interesting bug in the caching of lit addresses</li>
<li>Added support for accessing high registers directly using the 'sfr' directive. See libc/gb/sfr.s and gb/hardware.h for an example. It should be possible with a bit of work to make high ram directly usable by the compiler; at the moment it is experimental. You can test sfr's by enabling USE_SFR_FOR_REG=1</li>
<li>Added remove_VBL etc functions.</li>
<li>Documented the libs - see the gbdk-doc tarball distributed seperatly.</li>
<li>Two dimensional arrays seem to be broken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md136"></a>
GBDK 2.93</h2>
<p>6th April, 2000 <br  />
 From the README</p>
<ul>
<li>Added multi-bank support into the compiler - The old -Wf-boxx and -Wf-baxx options now work</li>
<li>Has preliminary support for generating rgbds and ISAS compatible assembler. Try -W&ndash;asm=rgbds or -W&ndash;asm=isas. The ISAS code is untested as I dont have access to the real assembler.</li>
<li>RSH is fixed</li>
<li>AND is fixed</li>
<li>The missing parts of 2.1.0's libs are there. Note: They are untested.</li>
<li>The dscan demo now fully works (with a hack :)</li>
<li>There is a bug with cached computed values which are later used as pointers. When the value is first used as a BYTE arg, then later as a pointer the pointer fails as the high byte was never computed and is now missing. A temporary fix is to declare something appropriate as 'volatile' to stop the value being cached. See dscan.c/bombs() for an example.</li>

GBDK 2.92-2 for win32</h2>
<p>26th March, 2000 <br  />
 This is a maintenance release for win32 which fixes some of the niggly install problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>win32 only. Takes care of some of the install bugs, including:<ul>
<li>Now auto detects where it is installed. This can be overridden using set GBDKDIR=...</li>
<li>Problems with the installer (now uses WinZip)</li>
<li>Problems with the temp directory Now scans TMP, TEMP, TMPDIR and finally c: tmp</li>
<li>cygwin1.dll and 'make' are no longer required gbdk is now built using mingw32 which is win32 native make.bat is automagically generated from the Makefile</li>
<li>I've reverted to using WORD for signed 16 bit etc. GBDK_2_COMPAT is no longer required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WORDS are now back to signed. GBDK_2_COMPAT is no longer needed. Temporary files are created in TMP, TEMP, or TMPDIR instead of c: tmp The installer is no more as it's not needed. There is a WinZip wrapped version for those with the extra bandwidth :). gbdk autodetects where it is installed - no more environment variables. cygwin1.dll and make are no longer required - gbdk is now compiled with mingw32.</p>
<p>See the ChangeLog section in the README for more information.</p>

 Problems with the installer. It seems that the demo of InstallVISE has an unreasonably short time limit. I had planed to use the demo until the license key came through, but there's no sign of the key yet and the 3 day evaluation is up. If anyone knows of a free Windows installer with the ability to modify environment variables, please contact me. I hear that temporarily setting you clock back to the 15th works...</p>

 libc5 version available / "Error creating temp file" Thanks to Rodrigo Couto there is now a Linux/libc5 version of gbdk3-2.92 available - follow the download link above. At least it will be there when the main sourceforge site comes back up... Also some people have reported a bug where the compiler reports '*** Error creating temp file'. Try typing "mkdir c: tmp" from a DOS prompt and see if that helps.</p>

GBDK 2.92</h2>
<p>8th March, 2000 <br  />
 Better than 2.91 :). Can now be installed anywhere. All the demos work. See the README for more.</p><ul>
<li>All the examples now work (with a little bit of patching :)<ul>
<li>Fixed problem with registers being cached instead of being marked volatile.</li>
<li>More register packing - should be a bit faster.</li>
<li>You can now install somewhere except c: gbdk | /usr/lib/gbdk</li>
<li>Arrays initialised with constant addresses a'la galaxy.c now work.</li>
<li>Fixed minor bug with 104$: labels in as.</li>
<li>Up to 167d/s... <br  />
</li>
</ul>

GBDK 2.91</h2>
<p>27th Feb, 2000 <br  />
 Better than 2.90 and includes Linux, win32 and a source tar ball. Some notes:</p>
<p>Read the README first Linux users need libgc-4 or above. Debian users try apt-get install libgc5. All the types have changed. Again, please read the README first. I prefer release early, release often. The idea is to get the bugs out there so that they can be squashed quickly. I've split up the libs so that they can be used on other platforms and so that the libs can be updated without updating the compiler. One side effect is that gb specific files have been shifted into their own directory i.e. gb.h is now gb/gb.h.</p>
<p>23rd Feb, 2000 <br  />
 First release of gbdk/sdcc. This is an early release - the only binary is for Linux and the source is only available through cvs. If your interested in the source, have a look at the cvs repository gbdk-support first, which will download all the rest of the code. Alternatively, look at gbdk-support and gbdk-lib at cvs.gbdk.sourceforge.net and sdcc at cvs.sdcc.sourceforge.net. I will be working on binaries for Win32 and a source tar ball soon. Please report any bugs through the bugs link above.</p>
<p>31st Jan, 2000 <br  />
 Added Dermot's far pointer spec. It's mainly here for comment. If sdcc is ported to the Gameboy then I will be looking for some way to do far calls.</p>
<p>8th Jan, 2000 <br  />
 Moved over to sourceforge.net. Thanks must go to David Pfeffer for gbdk's previous resting place, www.gbdev.org. The transition is not complete, but cvs and web have been shifted. Note that the cvs download instructions are stale - you should now look to cvs.gbdk.sourceforge.net. I am currently working on porting sdcc over to the Z80. David Nathan is looking at porting it to the GB.</p>

 Bug tracking / FAQ up. Try the link on the left to report any bugs with GBDK. It's also the first place to look if your having problems.</p>

GBDK 2.1.5</h2>
<p>17th Oct, 1999 <br  />
</p>
<p>The compiler is the same, but some of the libraries have been improved. <a class="el" href="string_8h.html#a23e7549e1468d21419457759150fa767">memset()</a> and <a class="el" href="string_8h.html#a1bb96f23101e1f8c053a36d59a01d3f8">memcpy()</a> are much faster, <a class="el" href="stdlib_8h.html#a7ac38fce3243a7dcf448301ee9ffd392">malloc()</a> is fixed, and a high speed fixed block alternative <a class="el" href="stdlib_8h.html#a7ac38fce3243a7dcf448301ee9ffd392">malloc()</a> was added. </p>
