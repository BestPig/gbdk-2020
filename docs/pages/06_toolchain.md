@anchor toolchain_overview
# Overview
GBDK 2020 uses the SDCC compiler along with some custom tools to build Game Boy ROMs.
- All tools are located under `bin/`
- The typical order of tools called is as follows. (When using lcc these steps are usually performed automatically.)
  1. Compile and assemble source files (.c, .s, .asm) with @ref sdcc and @ref sdasgb
  2. Optional: perform auto banking with @ref bankpack on the object files
  3. Link the object files into .ihx file with @ref sdldgb
  4. Validate the .ihx file with @ref ihxcheck
  5. Convert the .ihx file to a ROM file (.gb, .gbc) with @ref makebin

To see individual arguments and options for a tool, run that tool from the command line with either no arguments or with `-h`.


# Data Types
For data types and special C keywords, see @ref file_asm_gbz80_types_h "asm/gbz80/types.h" and @ref file_asm_types_h "asm/types.h".

Also see the SDCC manual (scroll down a little on the linked page): http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/doc/sdccman.pdf#section.1.1


@anchor toolchain_changing_important_addresses 
# Changing Important Addresses
It is possible to change some of the important addresses used by the toolchain at link time using the -Wl-g XXX=YYY and =Wl-b XXX=YYY flags (where XXX is the name of the data, and YYY is the new address). 

@ref lcc will include the following linker defaults for @ref sdldgb if they are not defined by the user.

  - `_shadow_OAM`
    - Location of sprite ram (requires 0xA0 bytes).
    - Default `-Wl-g _shadow_OAM=0xC000`

  - `.STACK`
    - Initial stack address
    - Default `-Wl-g .STACK=0xE000`

  - `.refresh_OAM`
    - Address to which the routine for refreshing OAM will be copied (must be in HIRAM). Default
    - Default `-Wl-g .refresh_OAM=0xFF80`

  - `_DATA`
    - Start of RAM section (starts after Shadow OAM)
    - Default `-Wl-b _DATA=0xc0A0`

  - `_CODE`
    - Start of ROM section
    - Default `-Wl-b _CODE=0x0200`


@anchor toolchain_compiling_programs
# Compiling programs

The @ref lcc program is the front end compiler driver for the actual compiler, assembler and linker. It works out what you want to do based on command line options and the extensions of the files you give it, computes the order in which the various programs must be called and then executes them in order. Some examples are:

  - Compile the C source 'source.c', assemble and link it producing the Gameboy image 'image.gb'

        lcc -o image.gb source.c

  - Assemble the file 'source.s' and link it producing the Gameboy image 'image.gb'

        lcc -o image.gb source.s

  - Compile the C program 'source1.c' and assemble it producing the object file 'object1.o' for later linking.

        lcc -c -o object1.o source1.c

  - Assemble the file 'source2.s' producing the object file 'object2.o' for later linking

        lcc -c -o object2.o source2.s

  - Link the two object files 'object1.o' and 'object2.o' and produce the Gameboy image 'image.gb'

        lcc -o image.gb object1.o object2.o

  - Do all sorts of clever stuff by compiling then assembling source1.c, assembling source2.s and then linking them together to produce image.gb. 

        lcc -o image.gb source1.c source2.s

Arguments to the assembler etc can be passed via lcc using -Wp..., -Wf..., -Wa... and -Wl... to pass options to the pre-processor, compiler, assembler and linker respectivly. Some common options are:

  - To generate an assembler listing file.

        -Wa-l

  - To generate a linker map file.

        -Wl-m

  - To bind var to address 'addr' at link time.

        -Wl-gvar=addr

For example, to compile the example in the memory section and to generate a listing and map file you would use the following. Note the leading underscore that C adds to symbol names.

    lcc -Wa-l -Wl-m -Wl-g_snd_stat=0xff26 -o image.gb hardware.c


@subsection Makefiles
Using Makefiles

Please see the sample projects included with GBDK-2020 for a couple different examples of how to use Makefiles.

You may also want to read a tutorial on Makefiles. For example:

@anchor build_tools
# Build Tools

@anchor lcc
## lcc
lcc is the compiler driver (front end) for the GBDK/sdcc toolchain.

For detailed settings see @ref lcc-settings

It can be used to invoke all the tools needed for building a rom.
If preferred, the individual tools can be called directly.
- the `-v` flag can be used to show the exact steps lcc executes for a build
- lcc can compile, link and generate a binary in a single pass: `lcc -o somerom.gb somesource.c`
- @anchor lcc_debug
  lcc now has a `-debug` flag that will turn on the following recommended flags for debugging
    - `--debug` for sdcc (lcc equiv: `-Wf-debug`)
    - `-y` enables .cdb output for @ref sdldgb (lcc equiv: `-Wl-y`)
    - `-j` enables .noi output for @ref sdldgb (lcc equiv: `-Wl-j`)


@anchor sdcc
## sdcc
SDCC C Source compiler

For detailed settings see @ref sdcc-settings

- Arguments can be passed to it through @ref lcc using `-Wf-<argument>` and `-Wp-<argument>` (pre-processor)

@anchor sdasgb
## sdasgb
SDCC Assembler for the gameboy

For detailed settings see @ref sdasgb-settings

- Arguments can be passed to it through @ref lcc using `-Wa-<argument>`


@anchor bankpack
## bankpack
Automatic Bank packer

For detailed settings see @ref bankpack-settings

When enabled, automatically assigns banks for object files where bank has been set to `255`, see @ref rom_autobanking.
Unless an alternative output is specified the given object files are updated with the new bank numbers.
- Can be enabled by using the `-autobank` argument with @ref lcc.
- Must be called after compiling/assembling and before linking
- Arguments can be passed to it through @ref lcc using `-Wb-<argument>`

Limitations
- `__banked` functions cannot be called from within the same source file they are declared in.
- With data it is easier, because if you access data from the code in the same bank you donâ€™t need to switch the bank (access to `__bank_*` symbol).


@anchor sdldgb
## sdldgb
The SDCC linker for the gameboy.

For detailed settings see @ref sdldgb-settings

Links object files (.o) into a .ihx file which can be processed by @ref makebin
- Arguments can be passed to it through @ref lcc using `-Wl-<argument>`


@anchor ihxcheck
## ihxcheck
IHX file validator

For detailed settings see @ref ihxcheck-settings

Checks .ihx files produced by @ref sdldgb for correctness.
- It will warn if there are multiple writes to the same ROM address. This may indicate mistakes in the code or ROM bank overflows
- Arguments can be passed to it through @ref lcc using `-Wi-<argument>`


@anchor makebin
## makebin
IHX to ROM converter

For detailed settings see @ref makebin-settings

Converts .ihx files produced by @ref sdldgb into ROM files (.gb, .gbc).
- Arguments can be passed to it through @ref lcc using `-Wm-<argument>`


@anchor gbdk_utilities
# GBDK Utilities


@anchor utility_gbcompress
## GBCompress
Compresssion utility

For detailed settings see @ref gbcompress-settings

Compresses (and decompresses) binary file data with the gbcompress algorithm (also used in GBTD/GBMB). Decompression support is available in GBDK, see @ref gb_decompress().


@anchor utility_png2mtspr
## PNG to Metasprite
Tool for converting PNGs into GBDK format MetaSprites

Convert single or multiple frames of graphics into metasprite structured data for use with the ...metasprite...() functions.

For detailed settings see @ref png2mtspr-settings  
For working with sprite properties (including cgb palettes), see @ref metasprite_and_sprite_properties  
For API support see @ref move_metasprite() and related functions in @ref metasprites.h  

### Working with png2mtspr
  - The origin (pivot) for the metasprite is not required to be in the upper left-hand corner as with regular hardware sprites.

  - The conversion process supports using both SPRITES_8x8 and SPRITES_8x16 mode. If 8x16 mode is used then the height of the metasprite must be a multiple of 16.

  - It will attempt to deduplicate/re-use as many tiles as possible (including ones flipping on the X and Y axis) when building the tile set to be used by the convterted metasprite. This does mean that minor changes to the input graphics may change the numer and order of tiles in the resulting tile set.

  - While the tool supports both indexed and full color images as inputs, it only exports as a fixed 3 color + transparent palette per metasprite.
    - The input images are first converted to 32 bit RGBA color, then to greyscale (using `255 - ((R * 0.3f) + (G * 0.59f) + (B * 0.11f))`) and then to grouped into the 3 colors based on their brightness.
    - The brightness mapping is approximately as follows:

              Alpha 100% transparent pixels : Transparent
              ~78% - ~100% : Lightest/White
              ~26% - ~77%  : Medium
                0% - ~25%  : Darkest/Black

    - A fixed palette is used for export, the order of colors will get re-arranged to map onto this fixed palette. It is arranged/assumed as follows (An example would be `OBP0_REG = 0xE4` or `=0xE0`).

              OBP Index 0: Transparent
              OBP Index 1: Lightest/White
              OBP Index 2: Medium
              OBP Index 3: Darkest/Black

    - If you want to assign different colors then you can either change the settings in @ref OBP0_REG / @ref OBP1_REG in your _source code_ or change the colors of your _input image_ to produce different output, but the output of the png2mtspr tool itself cannot be altered (for now).

  For best graphics conversion results:
    - Input images should only have 3 colors + transparent and which are spaced along the brightness spectrum based on the mapping described above.
    - For optimal deduplication, try to align the graphics so that tiles used multiple times align on the same 8 pixel boundaries.

  @todo Support indexed color (non-remapped) for source images to bypass the brightness binning and palette mapping.
